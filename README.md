# Memory-Matching-Game
The game consists of closed cards and the aim is for the players to be able to open them all for one of the two to win. The cards are divided into pairs and players must combine them, using their memory to find the exact location of each card. The memory matching game is played in a grid of size chosen by the user and starts with all the cards closed. Each player has two moves at a time to click on a card and see what is hidden behind it. Only when both cards hide the same photo do they open, taking the points the player who found them. When all the cards are revealed, the player with the most points wins or a draw is made. The game is still played between the user and the computer and the results are saved in a txt file, i.e. the name of the winner, the points and the time that the game lasted.

With the start of the game the user can perform the following 6 functions:

  1. New Game
  2. Restart
  3. Exit
  4. Show History
  5. Hide History
  6. About

With the New Game option, the user enters his name and the name of the computer and chooses the size of the grid that the game will have, which corresponds to the degree of difficulty he desires. If he chooses Restart then the game is repeated with the names entered by the user in the previous round. Show History displays the history of previous rounds to the user and Hide History hides the window. With the About option the user sees information about the system and with Exit the application is terminated.
The system was implemented in Java and the development environment was NetBeans. The game's graphical interface was based on Java Swing (API) because it makes it easy to sort items such as buttons that the game needs to have.
